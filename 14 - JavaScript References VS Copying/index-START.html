    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //100 / 100

    console.log(name, name2); // wesley / wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team); // both same

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] ='lux'; //will change original (reference) Array
    console.log(players, team) //both same and both chagned

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //retruns entire array when nothing passed in */


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players); //original won't change when updated */

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; //will update the original 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const capt3 = {...person} //like es6 array spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      }
    }

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //makes a copy
    //but only of the first level not the inner levels.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //not recommended, shakes references */
